# German to English Machine Translation

This project aims to implement a machine translation model that translates text from the German language to English. The core idea is to leverage the Transformer architecture, as described in the "Attention Is All You Need" paper, to achieve accurate and efficient translation.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust and reliable machine translation system for German to English. The model will be trained on a large dataset of bilingual text to learn the mapping between German and English sentences. The resulting model will be capable of translating German text into English with high accuracy.

## Usage

- Train the model on your own dataset or use a pre-trained model.
- Perform translation from German to English using the trained model.
- Evaluate the translation quality and make improvements as needed.
